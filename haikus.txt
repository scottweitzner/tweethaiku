In the twilight rain these brilliant-hued hibiscus - A lovely sunset
From time to time The clouds give rest To the moon-beholders.
No one travels Along this way but I, This autumn evening.
In the cicada's cry No sign can foretell How soon it must die.
An old silent pond... A frog jumps into the pond, splash! Silence again.
Over-ripe sushi, The Master Is full of regret.
Blowing from the west Fallen leaves gather In the east.
The wren Earns his living Noiselessly.
Winter seclusion - Listening, that evening, To the rain in the mountain.
Sparrow's child out of the way, out of the way! the stallion's coming through
Don't weep, insects Lovers, stars themselves, Must part.
Consider me As one who loved poetry And persimmons.
My life, How much more of it remains? The night is brief.
Toward those short trees We saw a hawk descending On a day in spring.
I kill an ant and realize my three children have been watching.
Over the wintry forest, winds howl in rage with no leaves to blow.
